lyrics
======

This started as a script that simply opens search results with the
current song title, so I can reference lyrics; now it is a bit more
advance, and has a bit more features, thus the name is not properly
representing of it.

If you end up using this, and you find a song for which it can't open
the lyrics, please submit an issue with the song name or spotify uri.

features
========

 - next song (FN + F11)

 - open lyrics in browser (FN + F12)

 - URI scheme handler for "spotify:" urls
(the native functionaly in the player, '--uri', is utterly broken)

usage as hotkeys handler
========================

I am running this tool by abusing acpi event, to be more exact the
ibm/thinkpad hotkey events. This is perfect for me, as the keys are
near my hand and I do not use the for their intended functions anyway.

 - make a link to a more permanent location
   - eg. 'ln -s /path/to/repo/lyrics /dmarto/bin/lyrics'

 - copy the hotkey event config
   - eg. 'cp ibm-hotkey /etc/acpi/events/ibm-hotkey'

(note: don't forget to change the username & path in the config)

usage as scheme handler
=======================

My browser of choice is Firefox.

 - add 'sportify-uri.user.js' to your userscript manager
    https://github.com/dmarto/lyrics/raw/master/sportify-uri.user.js

 - open 'about:config' and add the following prefs

   - as bool
    - network.protocol-handler.external.spotify
    - true

   - as string
    - network.protocol-handler.app.spotify
    - /dmarto/bin/lyrics

(note: again, path to file may need a change)

notes
=====

If you are not using cinnnamon, you will need to change the first few
lines of the script, to make your dbus happy. Everything else is plug
and play.
